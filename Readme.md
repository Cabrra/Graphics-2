Nightmare Scene
===============

## Usage

This project was part of the Graphics-II course (Game Development degree) from Full Sail University. 
The repo includes the C++ code to run the shaders and visualize the effects in a multi-threaded environment using DirectX 10. The scene is composed by:
+ Drawing models loaded from file
+ 100 zombies that are getting out from the grouns
+ Trees with leaves, textures and normal mapping
+ Water generated solely using shaders
+ A cube with dynamic shaders (pressing V/M/Space updates the texture)
+ A tower model with textures and normal mapping
+ Monster models with textures and normal mapping
+ Dynamically generated terrain using noise mapping from a image rgb mapping
+ Proceduraly created indexed triangle primitive based geometry
+ Texture mapping -> a scene within a scene
+ Infinite skybox
+ Applied functional per pixel directional light to drawn geometry
+ Applied functional per pixel point light to drawn geometry 
+ Applied functional per pixel spot light to drawn geometry
+ Real time rendering
+ Transparent geometry sorted by depth and drawn in correct order

The scene is fully traversable pressing the movement keys
