Nightmare Scene
===============

## Usage

This project was part of the Graphics-II course (Game Development degree) from Full Sail University. 
The repo includes the C++ code to run the shaders and visualize the effects in a multi-threaded environment using DirectX 10. The scene is composed by:
+ 100 zombies that are getting out from the grouns
+ Trees with leaves, textures and normal mapping
+ Water generated solely using shaders
+ A cube with dynamic shaders (pressing V/M/Space updates the texture)
+ A tower model with textures and normal mapping
+ Monster models with textures and normal mapping
+ Real time rendering

The scene is fully traversable pressing the movement keys
